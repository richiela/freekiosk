/**
 * Slides the dashboard tiles kept loaded side by side, like desktops, under a sideways
 * two-finger drag (TwoFingerSwipeDetector). It runs on the UI thread, fed straight from
 * MainActivity.dispatchTouchEvent, so the tiles move in the same frame as the fingers with no
 * trip through JS, and the settle or spring-back animation runs here too.
 *
 * KioskScreen tells it which views are the tile on screen and its neighbours ([setTiles]) and
 * hears about a switch only once the slide has finished, with every finger already up, then
 * makes the new tile the shown one.
 *
 * As soon as two fingers land ([begin]), before anything moves, the neighbours are placed just
 * off screen on either side and every tile gets a GPU layer, so a drag only moves three ready
 * textures as one strip. Measured on a MediaTek tablet with real two-finger input: without
 * layers the slide ran at about 30 fps (two web pages redrawn each frame); building them on
 * the first moving frame made the slide start with several 30-60 ms frames. The neighbours'
 * WebViews are woken at the same moment (a paused WebView draws nothing, so it would slide in
 * blank) and paused again afterwards, except the one that ends up on screen.
 *
 * The tile on screen is the one live page, and its redraws during a slide were what still cost
 * frames (its layer re-rendered). So it is also copied off the screen when the fingers land
 * (PixelCopy, a few ms on the GPU) and, during the slide, that picture moves in its place on
 * an overlay above the app while the page itself is not drawn. The page keeps running and sees
 * nothing; on a spring-back it is shown again in the frame the picture goes. Without the copy
 * in time (or before Android 8) the live tile slides instead.
